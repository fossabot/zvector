# ZVector Test Automation

This directory contains all the test automation for ZVector Library.

Test files are organised in 4 categories:

- 01U - Unit Tests

- 02I - Integration Tests

- 03A - Code Analysis (right now using cppcheck for static analysis and valgrind for dynamic, other analysis tools are used outside the automation and CodeQL code analysis is used on GitHub via Actions)

- 04P - Performance Tests
